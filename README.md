# Underwater Image Reconstruction using Convolutional Auto-encoder
This purpose of this research is to develop an image compression/reconstruction method for underwater communication with minimal distortion. The initial work involved understanding the functioning of autoencoder for seafloor image compression, transmission (from AUV to ship) and reconstruction similar to that of the original encoded image with minimal noise.The autoencoder model was build using keras, Tensorflow framework. We expect to achieve a good reconstructed image at the receiving end by maintaining a balance between bit rate and distortion. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the results obtained in terms of signal to noise ratio and image quality using SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).
The initial step involves loading the dataset using the load_test_data.py & load_train_data.py file. The input images of the following dimension (224x224x3 where, first & second dimensions represents the height & width of image, third dimension represents color channel(RGB)) is loaded and normalized.
